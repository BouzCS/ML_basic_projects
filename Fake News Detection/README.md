# :newspaper: Fake News Detector

***

Do you trust all the news you hear from social media?

All news are not real, right?

How will you detect fake news?

The answer is Python. By practicing this project of detecting fake news, you will easily make a difference between real and fake news.

# ‚úâÔ∏è What is Fake News?

***

A type of yellow journalism, fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas. Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.

# ü§ñ DATA PRE-PROCESSING AND MODELLING

***

In the project we tried six models to classify our dataset, in the Jupyter notebook you'll find Data pre-processing phases, and also the modelling of the six models

    1. Random_Forest
    2. Decision_Trees
    3. Naive_Bayes
    4. XGBoost
    5. SVC
    6. PassiveAggressiveClassifier
   
   
# :pushpin: SCORE OF MODELS

***

#### For the score we used the "Accuracy score"

Model | Random_Forest | Decision_Trees | Naive_Bayes | XGBoost | SVC | PassiveAggressiveClassifier
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |---
Accuracy Score | 91.69% | 81.9% | 87% | 91.48% | 91.42% | 92.28%

# :bar_chart: COMPARAISON BETWEEN MODELS

***


Now let's compare all the seven models, and plot them in a barplot.
